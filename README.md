# EEG-based Emotion Recognition using Windowing Techniques

This project implements an **EEG-based emotion recognition model** that classifies emotions based on the **Valence** and **Arousal** dimensions.  
We use **windowing techniques** to segment EEG signals, extract time- and frequency-domain features, and train multiple machine learning models to evaluate performance.

## ðŸ“„ Overview

- **Dataset:** DREAMER dataset â€“ 23 participants, 18 recordings each.
- **Labels:**  
  - **Arousal** â€“ the intensity of emotion (low = calm, high = excited).  
  - **Valence** â€“ the pleasantness of emotion (negative = unpleasant, positive = pleasant).  
- **Feature Extraction:** From each time window, we extract:
  - Mean, standard deviation
  - Power in EEG frequency bands: Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma
- **Window Types Tested:**
  - 5s non-overlapping  
  - 10s non-overlapping  
  - 5s with 2s overlap (stride)  
  - 10s with 2s overlap (stride)
- **Models Used:**
  - **KNN** (K-Nearest Neighbors)
  - **SVM** (Support Vector Machine)
  - **RF** (Random Forest)

## ðŸ§  Emotion Dimensions

The emotion space is represented using **Valence-Arousal Model**:

| Dimension | Low Value Example | High Value Example |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------------|
| **Valence** | Sad, Angry        | Happy, Relaxed     |
| **Arousal** | Sleepy, Calm      | Excited, Stressed  |

Emotions can be mapped into quadrants using these two dimensions.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure


Each folder contains:
- **hold_out_*** â€“ Preprocessing and hold-out split for the given configuration
- **knn_model_*** â€“ KNN model training and evaluation
- **rf_model_*** â€“ Random Forest model training and evaluation
- **svm_model_*** â€“ SVM model training and evaluation

**Key Insights:**
- **Random Forest (RF)** achieved the highest accuracy in most configurations.
- **KNN** performed competitively, close to RF in several cases.
- **SVM** was weaker without overlap but improved significantly with larger windows and overlap.
- Overlapping windows generally **improved accuracy**, especially for SVM.
- With **stride**, larger window sizes often yielded better performance.
